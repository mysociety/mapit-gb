<section id="introduction">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The MapIt API (“MapIt”, the “Service”) is operated by mySociety Ltd, company
no. 5798215, of 483 Green Lanes, London N13 4BS (“mySociety”, “we” or “us).</p>
<p>By using MapIt or signing up for an account, you’re agreeing to these Terms,
which form a legally binding agreement. Please read them carefully - they
define the conditions under which you’re allowed to use MapIt.</p>
<P>In order to use MapIt, you must be at least 18 years old and legally able to
enter into contracts. If you use MapIt on behalf of a company or organisation
you warrant that you have the authority to accept these Terms on behalf of that
company or organisation.</p>
<p>mySociety reserves the right to update and change these Terms from time to
time without notice and at its sole discretion.</p>
</section>

<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to block, without warning, usage which violates any
of the following restrictions.</p>
<h3 id="rate-limiting">Rate limiting</h3>
<p>The ‘rate limit’ is the speed at which you make calls on the API.</p>
<p>Anonymous usage of MapIt is permitted, but is rate limited to 50 calls per
day, so we recommend that you create an account and use an API key.</p>
<p>With an account, the rate limit is an average of 1 call per second in a
rolling 3 minute period. If you need more than this, we can set you up a
dedicated service, which may have additional terms or restrictions; please
contact us to discuss.</p>
<h3 id="call-limits">Call limits</h3>
<p>The ‘call limit’ is the number of calls which can be made on the API in any
one month.</p>
<p>Call limits are described on our <a href="{% url "mapit_pricing" %}">pricing
page</a>. When creating an account you can pick the most appropriate plan for
your needs. In any one month, if you reach the call limit associated with your
current plan, you will have to cease your usage until the next month, or
upgrade to the next pricing level.</p>
<h3 id="charitable-use">Charitable use</h3>
<p>Low-volume charitable use of MapIt is free. This means direct use by
registered charities (not paid contractors working on behalf of a charity) or
by individuals pursuing a non-profit project on an unpaid basis, with a volume
of up to 10,000 calls per month. Higher volume charitable users get a 50%
discount off our standard pricing.</p>
<p>You can request charitable status as part of the account creation process,
and also at a later stage by updating your subscription (but we don’t provide
the discount retroactively).</p>
<p>You will be asked to provide charity registration details (if you represent
a charity), or (if you're an individual) enough about you and your project to
show us you meet the conditions above: you agree to provide true and complete
information, and inform us if your circumstances change.</p>
</section>

<section id="accounts">
<h2>Accounts</h2>
<p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup
process. This email address will be used if we need to contact you about
anything relating to your MapIt account or usage - please ensure you keep your
contact information up to date.</p>
<p>You’re responsible for all activity that takes place under your account, so
you must keep your password secure. mySociety cannot and will not be liable for
any loss or damage from your failure to maintain the security of your account
and password. You should immediately notify us if you become aware of any
unauthorised use of your account.</p>
</section>

<section id="termination">
<h2>Termination, cancellation and suspension</h2>
<p>You can terminate this agreement at any time and for any reason by ceasing
use of MapIt and cancelling any subscription you have. You may also choose to
ask us to close your account, if you have one.</p>
<p>mySociety may suspend your access to MapIt if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have failed to make any payment due;
<li>mySociety reasonably believes you to be in material breach of any term of
this agreement;
<li>mySociety reasonably believes that it is necessary to do so in order to
comply with any applicable law or the order of a court or other competent
authority.
</ul>
<p>We also reserve the right to modify or terminate MapIt for any reason,
without notice at any time.</p>
</section>

<section id="payment">
<h2>Payment</h2>
<p>Our pricing is posted at <a href="{% url "mapit_pricing" %}
">https://mapit.mysociety.org/pricing/</a> and is subject to change upon 30
days notice from us.</p>
<p>Your plan is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. You
must at all times ensure we are provided with valid credit or debit card
information and authorise us to deduct the monthly charges against that
card.</p>
<p>If we’re unable to process your payment we’ll try to contact you by email.
We reserve the right to limit or suspend your account until we can take
payment.</p>
</section>

<section id="copyright">

<h2>Copyright</h2>

<p>Nothing in these Terms is intended to transfer the ownership of any
intellectual property from one party to the other.</p>

<p>MapIt contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database rights
2010-17; NISRA data © Crown copyright; Royal Mail data © Royal Mail copyright
and database rights (Code-Point Open) 2010-17; National Statistics data © Crown
copyright and database rights 2010-17 (ONSPD) and © Crown copyright 2004 (Super
Output Areas).</p>

<p>The data is generated from sources outside mySociety and so mySociety
cannot, and does not, warrant that it is accurate. mySociety accepts no
liability for any errors. For the same reason, while we will take all
reasonable steps to ensure that all data that is made available will continue
to be available in the future, mySociety cannot, and does not, agree to keep
the data up to date. We may, in our absolute discretion, add new data sources,
data fields or other forms of information from time to time but we are under no
obligation to do so.</p>

</section>

<section id="licensing">
<h2>Licensing</h2>
<p>mySociety believes that the data may be used in accordance with these
licences given by third parties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Great Britain non-SOA data may be used under the terms of the
    <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/opendata/licence/">OS OpenData licence</a> (PDF).
<li>Northern Ireland boundaries may be used under the
    <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/open-government-licence.htm">Open Government Licence</a>.
<li>Northern Ireland postcode data may be used under the terms of the
    <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/licences">Northern Ireland End User Licence</a>.
<li>Great Britain Output Area and Super Output Area data may presumably be used under OS OpenData and the
    <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/open-government-licence.htm">Open Government Licence</a>.
</ul>

<p>but mySociety cannot know whether those licences were validly given, and in
consequence, gives no warranty as to the ownership of the data or the use to
which it may be put.</p>

<p>You must comply with the licence or licences relevant to the data you use,
and you are responsible for satisfying yourself that any use for which you
employ the data is lawful and does not infringe anyone’s intellectual property
rights.</p>

</section>

<section id="attribution">
<h2>Attribution</h2>
<p>Please attribute us with the text “Powered by Mapit” and a link back to the
MapIt front page. You must also give any appropriate attribution(s) required by
the data licences.</p>
</section>

<section id="support">
<h2>SLA and support</h2>
<p>mySociety offers no guarantee as to the availability of MapIt, and will not
be liable if MapIt is unavailable for any reason.</p>
<p>If you need to contact us you can do so via our contact page.</p>
</section>

<section id="small-print">
<h2>Small print</h2>
<p>These Terms are subject to the law of England and Wales. They constitute all
the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and mySociety and supersede
any prior agreements, whether written or oral.</p>
<p>You expressly understand and agree that to the maximum extent permitted by
law mySociety excludes all liability and responsibility to you for any loss or
damage resulting, directly or indirectly, from your use of or inability to use
MapIt. In any event, our total liability for all claims made about MapIt in any
month will be no more than what you paid us for the Service the month before.</p>
<p>mySociety shall not be deemed to have waived its right to enforce any of its
rights under this agreement merely because it has previously failed to enforce
its rights under this agreement, or permitted you to breach any term of this
agreement on one or more occasions.</p>
<p>If a court, or other competent authority, finds that any term of this
agreement is illegal or otherwise unenforceable, that term is to be treated as
if it had been severed from this agreement. Its severance will be treated (as
far as possible) as having no effect on the remainder of this agreement.</p>
</section>

<section id="privacy">
<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>You can read mySociety’s general privacy policy here:
<a href="https://www.mysociety.org/privacy/">https://www.mysociety.org/privacy/</a>.
</p>

<p>In summary, we take your privacy seriously. We will use the personal data
that you provide to us solely for the purpose of administering the service, and
we will not disclose it to anyone else unless we are obliged to by law. We’ll
only ever send you emails in relation to your use of MapIt. Whilst we sometimes
use cookies and Google Analytics to help us make our websites better, you can
block this if you want to, and we provide information about how to do so.</p>

<p>We use Stripe for processing payments. You can read about Stripe’s usage
terms and privacy policy here: <a
