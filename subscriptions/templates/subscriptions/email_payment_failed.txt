Hi,

I'm afraid that when we tried to take payment for your subscription to MapIt,
it failed. It is possible that this is due to your bank requiring extra
confirmation of the payment, in which case you will also receive an email from
our payment processor containing a link to provide that extra confirmation.

Otherwise, we'll try again in three days time, but please could you log in to
MapIt and check that your payment details are up to date.

In the meantime, your quota has not been reset.

Please get in touch if you have any questions, you can reply to this email.

Yours,
mySociety
