Mapit GB
========

This repository houses a Django project which will eventually run
http://mapit.mysociety.org, mySociety's administrative boundary tool for the
UK.

If you're looking to create a MapIt in your country, work on any of the
underlying code, or re-use it as an app in another Django project, you
probably want https://github.com/mysociety/mapit. That repository is also where
mapit.mysociety.org currently runs from.

This repository is only for a new Django project that uses and deploys MapIt
in a separate way, so that we can include some specific additions that other
re-users of mapit may not want.
