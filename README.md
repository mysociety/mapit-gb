Mapit GB
========

This repository houses the Django project for http://mapit.mysociety.org,
mySociety's administrative boundary tool for the UK.

If you're looking to create a MapIt in your country, work on any of the
underlying code, or re-use it as an app in another Django project, you
probably want https://github.com/mysociety/mapit.

This repository is only for the Django project that uses and deploys MapIt at
http://mapit.mysociety.org and the specific additions we've made there.
